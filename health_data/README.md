# Assignment 1.3 - Comparing Encoding Channels  

## 1 - Scatter Plots containing 3 attributes
<i>These graphs shows the average life expectancy in years (health) vs the GDP per capita (income) for a country. For each graph the countries are encoded using different encoding channels based on their region/subcontinent.</i>  <br />
 <br />
1.1 <br />
Region encoded as colour <br />

 <br />
1.2 <br />
Region encoded as marker <br />

 <br />
1.3 <br />
Region encoded as size <br />

## 2 - Scatter Plots containing 4 attributes
<i>These graphs shows the average life expectancy in years (health) vs the GDP per capita (income) for a country. For each graph the countries region is encoded using a marker and their populations are encoded using different encoding channels as detailed below.</i> <br />
 <br />
2.1 <br />
Region encoded as marker, Population encoded as size <br />

 <br />
2.2 <br />
Region encoded as marker, Population encoded as brightness/opacity <br />

 <br />
2.3 <br />
Region encoded as marker, Population encoded as colour <br />

 <br />

## 3 - Alternate visualization: Encode all 4 attributes in a single chart
This visualisation of a stacked bar graph shows the average life expectancy in years (health) binned vs the GDP per capita (income) for a country. The encoding channel colour was used to encode the region/subcontinent of the country and opacity was used to denote the population of each country. Tooltips and graph interaction are demonstrated via gifs in the GitHub repository listed above. <br />
